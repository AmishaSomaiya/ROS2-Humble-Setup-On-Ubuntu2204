As discussed in Readme, we will install the Humble Hawkbill, the stable and currently supported distribution of ROS2 released on May 23rd 2022 with an End of Life (EOL) date of May 2027. The steps for installation are as follows : 

Step 1 : Go to official documentation of ROS2-Humble Hawkbill distribution and click on Installation : 
```
https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html
```

Step 2 : There are 2 ways of installation : using binary packages or build from source. We will select the install from Debian Binary Packages. 







### Notes :
1. We selected the install from Debian Binary Packages since it results in a fully-functional and usable ROS2 and alos it is more convenient because it installs its necessary dependencies automatically and updates alongside regular system updates. On the other hand, building from source is for developers looking to alter or explicitly omit parts of ROS 2’s base. It is also recommended for platforms that don’t support binaries. Building from source also gives you the option to install the absolute latest version of ROS 2.

2. For Debian, access to root is essential. If root access is not available, select install from 'fat' drive. Also, debian is exclusive to Ubuntu, for mac or Windows, install from 'fat' drive.
